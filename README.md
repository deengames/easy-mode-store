Easy-mode store mod for Stardew Valley. Adds difficult-to-get things to Pierre's store, at affordable prices.


If you have any questions, comments, improvements, bugs, suggestions, etc. please open an issue [here](https://github.com/nightblade9/easy-mode-store/issues).

# Requirements

Requires the [Shop Tile Framework mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5005) and all transitive dependencies / related mods (Json Assets, etc.)

# Installation

Simply download and unzip the mod to your `Mods` directory and you're good to go

# Customization

If you wish to add your own items to the store, open up `shops.json`. Simply copy/paste the second-last item to make a new item. The fields are self-explanatory: 

- `ItemNames` specifies the in-game name of the item (in square brackets)
- `StockPrice` is the price (in gold) for the item
- `Stock` is how many of that item Pierre has, per-day

If you're interested in more complex configuration, check the Shop Tile Framework readme.
